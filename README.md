# My Portfolio @qinbeans.net

A simplification of my original website using Sveltekit and Supabase

## Why Supabase?

I think Supabase is easy to use and very accessible with great UI and language support. AWS has S3 and DynamoDB, but I can't use tools I'm more acquainted to--it's like being locked into their ecosystem, which would make it inaccessible. Cloudflare has many great options available, but R2 is just an extension of AWS which would make it fall under the same category as AWS. However I use Cloudflare for other things such as Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare's DDNS.
