# Navigating my mess

The frontend is broken up into pieces like lego.

- Assets can be thought of as aesthetic pieces -- things that belong to other pieces to make them look nice.

- Components are the small bricks that make up the larger chunks.

- Pages are the larger chunks consisting of components -- think LEGO instructions whre the instructions tell us to make things in chunks.

- Layouts are for formatting the markdown pages.

This might be a little backwards since Astro has a suggested filing structure, but this makes it easy for me to navigate.  For anyone who visits, this here is an attempt at explaining my thought process behind the structure I chose.
