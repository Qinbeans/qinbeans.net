        <h1 class="h1">Who Am I</h1>
        <p>My name is Ryan Fong.  I started off coding, if you can call visual languages like Scratch and Snap coding, in middle school.  I never imagined myself becoming a Computer Science major back then, but I think I'd be satisifed with the path I've chosen.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ever since I was probably a toddler, I've had a curiosity for things like climbing trees to see what trees had to offer or playing with LEGOs to see what I could make.  I think this curiosity is what drove me to Computer Science and to this day, I play with just about anything I can get my hands on.  This website is probably proof that I still play with whatever I can get my hands on since it's built with some niche methods, but you can read all about it in my docs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Most of my childhood consisted of me playing sports, participating in Boy Scouts, and occasionally watching TV.  I wasn't always the brightest student nor was I the most obedient at times, but I always tried to have fun while doing what was required.  It wasn't until much later that I realized I should put more effort into what I was doing and that was greatly attributed to my Boy Scout leadership roles that I was both elected and delegated into.  I had to take care of something like 40 boys at any given meeting, and at the same time make sure they were having fun.  After a while I grew somewhat tired of being a leader, and stepped down from my last leadership position, but you wouldn't have guessed that it was the highest position Boy Scouts had to offer.  I was a senior in high school at the time and felt I had nothing to offer the boys conidering I was about to age out (essentially I couldn't be a Boy Scout anymore).  So my last year in Boy Scouts was hanging out with friends and making memories.</p>

        <h1 class="h1">Experiences</h1>
        <p>For most of my experience in coding, I've used C++, but I was also playing with other languages like Rust and Golang.  Prior to university, I used Java.  My Java is a little rusty, but I'm pretty sure I retained most of the important aspects.  I have a good amount of experience with machine learning and by extension Python.  Other than that, I have used Javascript, SCSS/CSS, HTML, Vue, and Svelte in making websites.</p>

        <h1 class="h1">Ambitions And The Future</h1>
        <p>I aim to be a software engineer.  My intests currently are web development and mobile app design.  As for experience in those fields, I have used game engines like Unity and Cocos2D to build mobile apps and I've used frameworks like Vue, Svelte, Django, Revel, Chi, Gin, and Actix.  I most enjoyed backend development in Go for its simplicity and speed.  For frontend, I'm stuck between Vue and Svelte.  Svelte is the most straight forward but Vue has a larger user base than Vue.  I've slowly grown to like Svelte more and more, but I'm not committed to anyone framework.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the future I hope to expand upon everything as a whole, from hardware to software.  I hope to see myself playing with embedded systems and making websites as easily as this website with more functionality.</p>
